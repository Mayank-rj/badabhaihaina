                <li>
                  Save Money on Interest : Even a slight difference in interest
                  rates can save you lakhs over the loan tenure. Comparing
                  multiple options ensures you secure the lowest rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Understand Fees and Charges : Apart from interest rates,
                  lenders impose processing fees, prepayment penalties, and
                  other charges. A detailed comparison helps you avoid hidden
                  costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Choose the Right Tenure : Loan tenures impact both EMI and
                  total interest. Finding a loan with a flexible tenure allows
                  you to balance monthly payments and overall costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identify Special Benefits : Some lenders offer benefits like
                  zero prepayment penalties, top-up loans, or balance transfer
                  options. Comparing loans ensures you donâ€™t miss out on these
